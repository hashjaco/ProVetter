# ProVetter
A program that handles the tedious Prod Op tasks so I can focus on other things.

Starting as a Product Operations Associate at a tech company while wrapping up my career as a college, my main task was to screen applicants and improve onboarding. It was so repetitive that I figured it could be automated, so I did just that with Selenium since I hadn't gained access to the private endpoints yet. I also translated this to a multi-threaded Java application.
